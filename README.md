# Maze Explorer: A Shortest Path Game

## Description:
Maze Explorer is an immersive game developed in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework, offering players an exciting journey through intricate mazes. Utilizing a text file input format, players navigate through mazes composed of walls ('h'), pathways ('g'), a designated start point ('s'), and an elusive end point ('e'). With the implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, players embark on an adventure to discover the shortest path from start to finish.

## Key Features:

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Maze Explorer provides an interactive gaming experience, allowing players to explore mazes using intuitive controls and engaging visuals rendered with SFML. Players can utilize keyboard inputs or mouse clicks to guide their character through the maze.

- **Customizable Mazes:** The game offers flexibility through customizable maze layouts, enabling players to create unique challenges by editing text files. The maze configurations include walls, start and end points, and grassy pathways, fostering creativity and diverse gameplay experiences.

- **BFS Algorithm:** Behind the scenes, Maze Explorer employs the Breadth-First Search algorithm, a fundamental graph traversal technique, to efficiently discover the shortest path from the start point to the end point within the maze. This algorithm ensures optimal route planning, enhancing the strategic depth of the game.

- **Visual Feedback:** As players navigate through the maze, the game provides real-time visual feedback, highlighting the current position of the player character, valid movement options, and the shortest path discovered. This visual feedback aids players in decision-making and enhances the overall gaming experience.

- **Challenge and Exploration:** Maze Explorer challenges players to navigate through intricate mazes, overcome obstacles, and uncover the shortest path to victory. With each maze offering unique configurations and complexities, players are encouraged to experiment, strategize, and refine their problem-solving skills.

## How to Play:

1. **Launch the Game:** Begin your adventure by launching the Maze Explorer application.

2. **Select a Maze:** Choose a pre-existing maze or create a new one by editing the maze layout in a text file.

3. **Navigate the Maze:** Utilize keyboard controls or mouse clicks to guide your character through the maze, avoiding walls and obstacles along the way.

4. **Discover the Shortest Path:** Strategically plan your movements to uncover the shortest path from the start point ('s') to the end point ('e') using the BFS algorithm.

5. **Celebrate Victory:** Successfully navigate the maze to reach the end point, overcoming challenges and obstacles to emerge victorious.

## Conclusion:

Maze Explorer offers a captivating gaming experience, combining elements of exploration, strategy, and problem-solving. With its customizable maze layouts, intuitive controls, and implementation of the BFS algorithm, Maze Explorer promises hours of immersive gameplay and challenges players to unlock the secrets of each maze.
